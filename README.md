## Overview

Lumière Luxe & Co. /loo·mee·air/ is an ecommerce platform dedicated to offering products that promote both personal health and environmental sustainability. Our mission is to provide consumers with a convenient way to shop for goods that are good for their bodies and the planet.

Inspired by the French word for "light" as a reference to physical light or metaphorical light such as enlightenment or illumination - LL&Co is the embodiment of trying to bring to light items which often get overlooked in a world of fast fashion and consumerism. Items listed have been made sustainably and are a product of being sourced in a humanitarian manner. While many sites offer high quality products that are sourced from unknown places at a higher cost for revenue, LL&Co provides high quality items at a reasonable price as an equal pay opportunity to its manufacturers as well and it's makers. 

## Site

#### Logo was made to reflect minimalism and elegance by incorporating sun and greenery 
The "Lumière Luxe & Co." logo elegantly captures the brand's essence of luxury and sustainability.

1. Shape and Layout:

The logo is framed within an oval, symbolizing timeless elegance and continuity.

2. Iconography:

A radiant sun sits at the top, representing light, warmth, and the brand’s name, "Lumière."
Bordering the bottom of the oval are delicate eucalyptus leaves, symbolizing natural beauty, purity, and the brand's commitment to eco-friendly practices.

3. Text:

The name "Lumière Luxe & Co." is prominently displayed within the oval, with "Lumière Luxe" in an elegant serif font to convey luxury and sophistication, and "& Co." in a modern sans-serif font to add a contemporary touch.

4. Color Palette:

Gold: Used for the sun, emphasizing luxury and high quality.
Soft Green: For the eucalyptus leaves, highlighting sustainability and a connection to nature.
White or Soft Beige: Background or accent colors to maintain a clean and pure look.
