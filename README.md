## Overview

Lumière Luxe & Co. /loo·mee·air/ is an ecommerce platform dedicated to offering products that promote both personal health and environmental sustainability. Our mission is to provide consumers with a convenient way to shop for goods that are good for their bodies and the planet.

Inspired by the French word for "light" as a reference to physical light or metaphorical light such as enlightenment or illumination - LL&Co is the embodiment of trying to bring to light items which often get overlooked in a world of fast fashion and consumerism. Items listed have been made sustainably and are a product of being sourced in a humanitarian manner. While many sites offer high quality products that are sourced from unknown places at a higher cost for revenue, LL&Co provides high quality items at a reasonable price as an equal pay opportunity to its manufacturers as well and it's makers.
